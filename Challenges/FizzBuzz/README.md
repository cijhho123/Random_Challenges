## FizzBuzz: One Simple Interview Question


### In Tom Scott's [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPZ0pIK_wsc&ab_channel=TomScott) he presented the following problem:
>code something that'll play the children's game of FizzBuzz. FizzBuzz is really simple. Traditionally, it is played between two people, and you count up in turn, 1, 2, 3, 4,except every time there's a multiple of 3, you say "Fizz" instead of the number. And every time there's a multiple of 5, you say "Buzz".
So: 1, 2, fizz, 4, buzz, fizz, 7, 8, fizz, buzz, and so on and so on! And when it's a multiple of both, at 15, you say "FizzBuzz".
write a program that outputs FizzBuzz for the numbers 1 to 100.

### The catch
To make the program as elegant, maintainable and future-proofing as possible.
